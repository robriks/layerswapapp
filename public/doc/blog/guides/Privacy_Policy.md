### Does Layerswap require KYC?&#x20;

We require only email verification to enable transferring. However, you might be asked to pass KYC on Centralized Exchanges in case of high swap amount or detection of suspicious activity.

### Can the actual withdrawal amount be different than the requested?

Yes. If you're manually withdrawing from an exchange or network and send more or less than you have initially specified on Layerswap, the transfer will be completed with the sent amount. You'll shortly receive the amount you sent in the destination address.

_Please note that the withdrawal amount should still be within the limits shown on Layerswap._&#x20;
